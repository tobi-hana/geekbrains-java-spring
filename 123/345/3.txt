Paragraphs are the building blocks java of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of
length: a paragraph is a group of at jjava least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long,
etc. In reality, though, the unity and jjjava coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes
a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as a jjjjava group of sentences or a single sentence that forms
a unit (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and jjjjjava appearance do not determine whether a section
in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some jjjjjjava styles of writing, particularly journalistic
styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. jjjjjjjavaUltimately, a paragraph is a sentence or
group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handoujjjjjjjjavat, we will refer to this as the
controlling idea, because it controls what happens in the rest of the pajjjjjjjjjavaragraph.
